# RL-movie-recommender


### Abstract

The purpose of our research is to study reinforcement learning
approaches to building a movie recommender system.
We formulate the problem of interactive recommendation as
a contextual multi-armed bandit, learning user preferences
recommending new movies and receiving their ratings. We
show that using reinforcement learning solves the problem of
exploitation-exploration trade-off and the cold-start problem.
We integrate the novelty of movies to the model. We explore
a content based approach as well as a collaborative filtering
approach and both yield viable recommendation results.
